I made this app for my wife so she could easily categorize and count disruptions in her elementary school library. 

Doubles as a learning project in Rust + Yew.

The categories can be changed to suit your counting needs.

Uses `LocalStorage` to remember the counts across page loads. Does not send/receive any data.
